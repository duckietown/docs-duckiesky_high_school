## Lesson Title
Building Skill with Soldering

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)


### Purpose

Provide students with practical methods for improving their soldering on the drone.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding


### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

- hook

- Tips on how to best use soldering iron

- Student Experimentation

- Regroup and Discussion


### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_
Work in pairs, but if possible have one soldering unit for each student. Teacher should create these pairs to cater to each student's needs.

### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Materials needed**

For Students: (Set for one student): soldering iron, soldering mat, solder fume extractor, solder roll, solder flux, spare wire, proto board

For Teachers: Should have a set of their own to demonstrate to students


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Teacher should demonstrate a successfully executed soldering of wires using flux to create a circuit

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

Teacher should discuss:

- oxidation and how it affects the longevity of solder connections

- Flux, and how applying it to connection points before soldering can make for easier application of solder

- how different temperatures of the soldering iron can affect how well the solder applies

### Student Experimentation

Recommended: 35 minutes

Give the students the tools in the materials section, and ask them to solder wires together with and wiuthout flux, while also showing them how to get acclimated to using the various materials. This half hour should be dedicated to students becoming familiar and comfortable with using the soldering iron combined with flux.

Heads up for next lesson: Keep all soldering joints that are weak or problematic, they will be useful in the next lesson.
### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes/hours

Teacher should ask the students, on a scale of 1 to 10, how comforable they feel with the tools. If the majority of the class still feels uncomfortable, it might be wise to take half of another class to continue to work on their skills.
