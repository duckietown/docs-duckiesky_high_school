## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: X minutes/hours

Explain how sensors need to be read and interpreted quickly in robotics, especially on a drone. The slower we process the sensors' information on the drone, the more time it takes for us (or our computer) to react and control the flight. 

Bad: Problem: We need an automated way of doing the conversion to units. We need measurements many times each second. 

Better: Solution: Python! - a coding language whose purpose is “doing computing” (making mathematical computations or calculations quickly), not formatting text or interacting with the computer


**Python vocab**:

REPL (Read-eval-print loop): Also called interactive mode, a REPL is a quick way to interact with Python when trying easy commands 

Scripts: 

Function calls: 

Printing:
