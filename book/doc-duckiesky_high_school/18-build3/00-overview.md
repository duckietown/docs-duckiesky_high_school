# Build: 3 {#part:build3 status=ready}

In this phase of the build, you'll be adding the essential elements of every drone-- the motors, ESCs, and the flight controller. By the end of this build part, you will have a configured flight controller, and will spin the motors (without the props on).

Build Part 3 Instructions can be found in the [Operations Manual](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_part3_overview.html)
