# Build: 1 {#part:build1 status=ready}

In this first part of the build, you will create a circuit to provide power to the Raspberry Pi from the battery. You will make the circuit connections using the soldering skills that you've gained from the Soldering Module. By the end of this build part, you will be able to power up your Pi and connect to it on your base station!

Build Part 1 Instructions can be found in the [Operations Manual](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_part1_overview.html)
