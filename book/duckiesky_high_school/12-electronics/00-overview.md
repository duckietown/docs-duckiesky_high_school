# Electronics {#part:electronics status=ready}

The goals of this section are to cover the basics of electronic circuits, and to teach students how to solder. Depending on the technical background of your students, some, or all of this section may be skipped. For example, if students already know Ohm's Law, they may wish to skip the first two lessons in the circuitry subsection, but may be interested in the last lesson.
